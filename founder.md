                <h2>The Journey</h2>
                <p>I started writing code professionally in 2009, back when PHP 5 was cutting edge and MySQL was the only database most developers knew. Since then, I've built systems that have processed millions of transactions, served billions of API requests, and powered businesses from seed stage to IPO.</p>

                <p>My career has taken me through nearly every layer of the software stack—from optimizing database queries that shaved seconds off critical operations, to designing API architectures that scaled to handle millions of concurrent users. I've worked with startups racing to find product-market fit, mid-size companies navigating hypergrowth, and enterprises managing legacy systems that process billions in revenue.</p>

                <p>I founded Eternia Solutions with a simple philosophy: businesses deserve technical partners who understand both the code and the business outcomes. Too many development firms deliver features without understanding impact. We're different—every technical decision we make is rooted in your business objectives.</p>

            <div class="story-section">
                <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                <p>I'm energized by complex problems. The kind where the obvious solution won't work at scale. Where you need to understand the nuances of database indexing strategies, network topology, caching layers, and application architecture to find the right answer.</p>

                <p>Over the years, I've specialized in backend systems and API development because that's where the real engineering challenges live. Frontend frameworks come and go, but building a database that won't fall over under load? Designing an API that other developers will actually enjoy using? Creating a system architecture that makes future features easier, not harder? That requires deep expertise—and that's what I bring to every project.</p>

                <h2>How I Work</h2>
                <p>When you work with Eternia Solutions, you're working directly with me. No account managers, no project coordinators, no layers between your problem and the person solving it. I take a limited number of clients at a time so I can give each project the attention it deserves.</p>

                <p>I ask a lot of questions. I push back when I think there's a better approach. I care more about building the right thing than building fast—though experience has taught me how to do both. And I communicate in plain language, not technical jargon designed to obscure rather than clarify.</p>
